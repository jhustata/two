    "return list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command is your gateway to reviewing the most recent test results stored by Stata. It lists out all the statistics calculated by the last command, including the number of observations (`r(N)`), test statistics like chi-squared values (`r(chi2)`), and crucially, the p-value (`r(p)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, simply listing out the p-value isn't always enough, especially when preparing your findings for a broader audience, such as in peer-reviewed publications. The reporting of p-values follows specific conventions to enhance clarity and understanding. Let's explore how to apply these conventions using a conditional formatting approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.1 Introduction to the \"quietly\" Command\n",
    "\n",
    "The first block introduces the concept of running commands 'quietly' in Stata, which suppresses the output in the Results window.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "qui {\n",
    "    // Your Stata commands here\n",
    "} \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `qui {`: This command is short for 'quietly'. It tells Stata to execute the commands within the braces without displaying the usual output in the Results window. It's helpful for keeping your results clean or when you're only interested in the final outcome rather than seeing every step.\n",
    "- `}`: This closing brace marks the end of the 'quietly' section. After this point, Stata will return to its default behavior, which is to display output for each command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.2 Handling p-values Less Than 0.01\n",
    "\n",
    "The second block explains how to handle cases where p-values are less than 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "qui {\n",
    "    if r(p) < 0.01 {\n",
    "        local p: di \"p < 0.01\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `if r(p) < 0.01 {`: This line checks if the p-value (`r(p)`) from the last statistical test is less than 0.01. If true, the commands inside the braces will execute.\n",
    "- `local p: di \"p < 0.01\"`: Here, if the condition is met, we assign a formatted string \"p < 0.01\" to a local macro named `p`. This is a concise way to communicate that the test results are highly significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.3 Formatting p-values Between 0.01 and 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "The third block focuses on p-values that fall between 0.01 and 0.05, using precision formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "qui {\n",
    "    else if inrange(r(p),0.01,0.05) {\n",
    "        local p: di %3.2f r(p)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `else if inrange(r(p),0.01,0.05) {`: This line checks if the p-value is within the specified range. The `inrange()` function is versatile, allowing for clear boundary definitions.\n",
    "- `local p: di %3.2f r(p)`: For p-values in this range, we format the number to have two decimal places (e.g., 0.03), ensuring clarity and precision in our reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.4 Formatting p-values Greater Than 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth block deals with formatting p-values greater than 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "qui {\n",
    "    else {\n",
    "        local p: di %2.1f r(p)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",

    "\n",
    "- `else {`: This part catches any cases not previously covered, essentially p-values greater than 0.05.\n",
    "- `local p: di %2.1f r(p)`: Here, we format the p-value to have one decimal place, indicating a less strict interpretation of statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.5 Combining Everything\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we combine all the parts into a cohesive whole, demonstrating how to format p-values based on their value, all within a 'quietly' block.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "qui { //asks Stata to work \"quietly\", until the corresponding brace is closed at the end\n",
    "    if r(p) < 0.01 {\n",
    "       local p: di \"p < 0.01\"\n",

    "       local p: di %3.2f r(p)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    else {\n",
    "       local p: di %2.1f r(p)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    noi di \"p = `p'\"\n",
    "} //after this brace Stata may return to its default: \"noisely\" produce output as it runs the program\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- This final block puts everything together, showing how to use `qui` to suppress unnecessary output while precisely formatting p-values according to their significance level. The `noi di \"p = `p'`\" line then displays the formatted p-value, completing the explanation of how to communicate statistical results clearly and effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.6 Recap of the chi-square test\n",
    "\n",
    "In this script, we start by checking if the p-value is less than 0.01. If so, we report it as \"p < 0.01\" to indicate a very high level of statistical significance. This convention signals to the reader that the result is significant beyond the conventional thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value falls between 0.01 and 0.05, we report it in a standard numeric format (e.g., 0.03), maintaining two decimal places for precision. This range indicates statistical significance at the conventional 5% level, which is widely accepted in many research disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "For p-values greater than 0.05, we format them with one decimal place, acknowledging that while the result may not meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance, it is still worth reporting for a comprehensive understanding of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach to formatting and reporting p-values is not just about following academic conventions; it's about making your results clear and interpretable for your audience, facilitating better understanding and discussion of your research findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, here's how the output might look after applying our formatting script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    ". return list \n",
    "\n",
    "scalars:\n",
    "r(N) =  2000\n",
